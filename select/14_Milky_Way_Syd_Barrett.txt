What'd you ever say today
When you're in the milky way?
Oh, tell me please
Just to give you a squeeze

If I met you
I told you what to do
Seems a while since I could smile
The way you do

How many times, if I try
If I may when you're in the milky way?
Half of your time beside me only
Atmosphere, the singular
Seems a while since I could smile
The way you do

What can anyone mean to you
Standing in the milky way?
Take life easy
I mean so easy

Why so empty?
I told you I can tell you what to do
When I hold you and I tell you I love you
I feel that I'm way you do

Give a grasp of life today
When you're in the milky way
Oh, try to please
Knock on wood of the trees
Glad you, mold you
Mold you and hold you
Means five miles and everyway for you
