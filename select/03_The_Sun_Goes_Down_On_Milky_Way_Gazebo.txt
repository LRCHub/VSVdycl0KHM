The Sun goes down on milky way
Moon is high beyond the sky
But my hope is forever
Dancing all the night
One and only sight
Mephistopheles has got my soul for some promises
All the girls and boys,
Animals and toys
They can't understand insanity
They say I'm out of it,
And I can just admit
The Sun goes down on milky way
And I touch your velvet face
Moon is high on milky way
And I love you forever
Counting all the days,
Voodoo laws and plagues
And Dictatorships that tried to stop
Me from loving you
Shaking jungle beat,
Burning desert heat
And the freezing ice I crossed for you
Can't affect me now
I love you anyhow.
The Sun goes down on milky way
And I touch your velvet face
Moon is high on milky way
And I love you forever
The sun went down so long before
I could reach for your embrace
Moon is high beyond the sky
But my hope is forever
The Sun goes down on milky way
And I touch your velvet face
Moon is high on milky way
And I love you forever
The sun went down so long before
I could reach for your embrace
Moon is high beyond the sky
But my hope is forever
And I touch your velvet face
And I love you forever.
