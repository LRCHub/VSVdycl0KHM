Sometimes when this place gets kinda empty
Sounds of their breath fades with the light
I think about the loveless fascination
Under the milky way tonight

Lower the curtain down in Memphis
Lower the curtain down all night
I got no time for private consultation
Under the milky way tonight

I wish I knew what you were looking for
Might have known what you would find

And it is something quiet peculiar
Something shimmering and white
It leads you here despite your destination
Under the milky way tonight

I wish I knew what you were looking for
Might have know what you would find
I wish I knew what you were looking for
Might have known what you would find

And it's something quiet peculiar
Something shimmering and white
It leads you here despite your destination
Under the milky way tonight

I wish I knew what you were looking for
Might have know what you would find
I wish I knew what you were looking for
Might have known what you would find
