[00:14.87] Sometimes when this place gets kind of empty
[00:22.06] Sound of their breath fades with the light
[00:29.05] I think about the loveless fascination
[00:36.23] Under the Milky Way tonight
[00:49.73] 
[00:43.35] Lower the curtain down on Memphis
[00:50.34] Lower the curtain down, alright
[00:57.20] I got no time for private consultation
[01:04.56] Under the Milky Way tonight
[01:18.06] 
[01:11.77] Wish I knew what you were looking for
[01:18.61] Might have known what you would find
[01:36.61] 
[01:25.68] And it's something quite peculiar
[01:32.75] Something shimmering and white
[01:39.51] It leads you here, despite your destination
[01:46.93] Under the Milky Way tonight
[02:00.43] 
[01:53.81] Wish I knew what you were looking for
[02:01.07] Might have known what you would find
[02:07.99] Wish I knew what you were looking for
[02:15.19] Might have known what you would find
[02:33.19] 
[02:50.59] And it's something quite peculiar
[02:57.32] Something that's shimmering and white
[03:04.43] Leads you here, despite your destination
[03:11.68] Under the Milky Way tonight
[03:25.18] 
[03:18.65] Wish I knew what you were looking for
[03:25.74] Might have known what you would find
[03:32.70] Wish I knew what you were looking for
[03:39.89] Might have known what you would find
[03:57.89] 
[03:54.02] Under the Milky Way tonight
[04:01.08] Under the Milky Way tonight
[04:08.15] Under the Milky Way tonight
