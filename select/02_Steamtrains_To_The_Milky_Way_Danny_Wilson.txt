Hush little boulevard
Now close your eyes
I'm a millionaire in paris
In a raggedy man's disguise
I see through the glasses of the drunken blind
A city were tragedy is an industry
But it's food for a healthy mind

Sleep tight children of the world
Sleep tight remember always sleep at home

My home is a shelter from language and race
A wonderful mixture of grace and emotion and growing pains
Steam trains to the milky way

Hasta manana when the day is done
If i was a star above the ocean i would guide ever sailor home
Throw all of your mirrors up at the sky tonight
Maybe the sun has set for the final time and the world will be burning bright

Sleep tight children of the world
Sleep tight remember always sleep at home

My home is a shelter from language and race
A wonderful mixture of grace and emotion and growing pains
Steam trains to the milky way

I bought some gardenias at the market place
And i saw some old men playing checkers
And love on a young girl's face
Sing "when you're smiling" for the boy's return
Inside the fire is on and every friend i own is singing my favorite song

Dream on
Children of the world
Dream on
Remember always sleep at home

My home is a shelter from language and race
A wonderful mixture of grace and emotion and growing pains
Steam trains to the milky way
Steam trains to the milky way
